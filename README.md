# Running

Upload "MAIN COLAB.ipynb" to Google Colab and run it. It will download the dataset and the models and run the models on the dataset.

If running locally, download the dataset, unzip it in the root of the repository and download the models and place them in the `models` folder, then run the MAIN.ipynb notebook.
